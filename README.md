(Broly (ブロリー, Burorī) is the main antagonist in Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan and Dragon Ball Z: Broly - Second Coming. He was a Saiyan who was the latest of the Legendary Super Saiyans who appear every thousand years. Broly's name is a pun on the literal vegetable broccoli, which is even referenced in Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan when a drunk Master Roshi calls him "Broccoli".)
